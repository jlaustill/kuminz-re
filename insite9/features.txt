NEW INSITE™ FEATURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Installation upgrade capability
Upgrade from INSITE™ 7.5.3.

 - The INTELECT folder now contains a INSITE Engine Feature file. 
The individual engine help files have eliminated.  The INSITE Engine 
Feature file lists the help descriptions for the engines Features 
and Parameters, Diagnostic Test and Advanced ECM Data help content.

 - Audit Trail
The Audit Trail has been expanded to support up to 8 Audit Trail 
entries.  This only applies to products if supported by the calibration.

 - ECM Key Off Time
The required key off time may be more than 30 seconds for some 
products.  If supported by the calibration, INSITE will display
the required key off time when users are prompted to turn the key off.
This time is also displayed under the Data Monitor / Logger in INSITE.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New Product Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - ISB5.9 CM2150
 - ISB5.9/6.7 CM2880 ISN
 - ISZ13 CM2150 SN
 - QSZ CM2150
 - Turbocharger Actuator - The Turbocharger can be calibrated by 
INSITE by using the Programmable Datalink Device (PDD) option in
Calibration Selection.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calibration Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Calibration Selection
The Calibration Selection has been redesigned to include a separate
section for Programmable Datalink Device (PDD) Calibrations such as
the Aftertreatment Device or Turbocharger.  This will allow users 
to bypass connecting to the ECM and download directly to a PDD. 

 - Network Drive Performance Improvement
A performance improvement has been implemented for reading 
calibrations on network drives.  This greatly reduces the time
INSITE spends when the "View Network Calibration Drives" is
selected in the Tools > Options > General menu.
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New Features and Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
***These will only be displayed if they are supported by the 
calibration.

 - Features and Parameters
The column widths will remain on the same between INSITE sessions.

 - Anti-Lock Brake (ABS) Controller
This feature provides the capability to enable the Anti-Lock Brake
(ABS) Controller.

 - Cab PTO 
This feature allows the operator to enable or disable the operation
of PTO from inside the cab.

 - Fan Minimum Run Time
This allows the user to set the minimum time that the fan will run
each time it turns on.

 - Idle Shutdown Hot Ambient Air Temperature Automatic Override
This allows the operator to choose override of the Idle Shutdown 
Hot Ambient Air Temperature Override threshold.

 - Parking Brake Interlock Type
This allows the user to program whether or not PTO is allowed when
the Parking Brake is off.  When the interaction is enabled, PTO is
allowed only when Parking Brake is ON.  When the interaction is 
disabled, PTO is allowed regardless of the Parking Brake Switch Status. 

 - Step Size Adjustment
This feature provides the ability to configure the amount of increase
and decrease in step size when adjusting the Maximum Vehicle Speed 
using the Cruise Control Set / Resume switches when the Smart Road
Speed Governor feature is enabled.

 - Transmission Neutral Interlock
This feature allows PTO to be turned on only if the transmission
is in neutral and disengages PTO when the transmission is taken 
out of the Neutral position.  This feature does not apply when 
the transmission type is manual.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Advanced ECM Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Advanced ECM Data
INSITE will only display Advanced ECM Data features if they are 
supported by the calibration.
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ECM Diagnostic Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - ECM Diagnostic Test 
INSITE will only display ECM Diagnostic Tests if they are 
supported by the calibration.

 - Fuel Injector Performance Test
This will test all fuel injectors at multiple predetermined fuel rail
pressures by monitoring the pressure drops across individual injectors
at multiple test points.  It will compare this data to the 
pre-determined limits for each test point. A Passed or Failed result
will be displayed along with status for each applicable cylinder and
test points.  This only applies to the ISX 12/11.9/15 CM2250.

 - Diesel Exhaust Fluid Doser Pump Override Test
This test has been updated to include a 90 second initializing time 
before dosing starts.  This allows the system to fully energize 
before the test starts.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Data Monitor / Logger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Data Monitor / Logger
The column widths will remain on the same between INSITE sessions.

Minimum Measured and Maximum Measured values read by INSITE while
the parameters are being monitored.
