# This file is used to determine the base rate for BAM/IDL
# when using ForeGroundActivated trigger type. The base rate
# will be used by Calterm III to calculate multiplier for 
# the module hence the requested rate can be set correctly.

# Format: <Product ID>,<Base Rate in ms>
# e.g. EC2,20 means product EC2 has a base rate of 20 ms 
# for time based trigger.

# If the Product ID is not listed or if there is an error occurred
# in parsing this file then base rate of 20 ms will be used.

# WARNING !!!!
# This file may not exist in the later release of Calterm III.
# Please submit a PRCR againsts Calterm III with your modification 
# to this file so that we can include the correct base rate in the 
# later release.

# Put your modification below
