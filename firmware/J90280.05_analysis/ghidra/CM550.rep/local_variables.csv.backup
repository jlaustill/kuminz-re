# Format: The third column is now the ADDRESS where the variable is first assigned/used
# Run the script once with placeholder addresses (like 0x0) to see actual first-use addresses
# Then update this file with the correct addresses from the debug output
#
# Example workflow:
# 1. Add entry with first_use_address=0x0 (will fail but show available variables)
# 2. Check output for "Available variables:" with their first-use addresses
# 3. Update the CSV with the correct first-use address
# 4. Re-run the script

# Index-based discovery: use 0-99 as first_use_address to select variable by index
# Script lists variables sorted by first-use address, selects by index, updates CSV with real address
# Use index 99 (out of range) to see list of available variables with their indices
# Variables from discovery (sorted by first-use address):
