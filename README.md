# kuminz-re

Reverse engineering monorepo for Cummins ECU systems. Analyzes e2m calibration files, ECU firmware, and diagnostic tools to understand how Cummins engine controllers work.

## Constraints

- **No Insite Traffic Capture** - Capturing real Insite diagnostic traffic is NOT an option. Protocol must be reverse-engineered from firmware analysis and decompiled code only.

## Documentation

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed project structure, commands, and development guidelines.
